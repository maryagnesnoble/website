My aim is to create a fairly comprehensive online archive of George
Eliot's novels, essays, reviews, letters and other writings. I will
soon add a search tool, and I'll add more Eliot materials whenever I
get a chance. I'd welcome suggestions and requests - please contact me
at mnoble at princeton.edu

## Dear Mary, note that you can insert a single line of literal HTML as follows:
#+html: <br>
## you can also do it like you've done further down the page, but remember the underscores (you had ommitted them). Case doesn't matter (I find the caps a bit ugly).

The texts of Eliot's novels are from Project Gutenburg. The essays,
reviews &c. are photocopied (from the journals in which they were
originally published), scanned, and turned into text with OCR software
plus a good deal of human editing.
