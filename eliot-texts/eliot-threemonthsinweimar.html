<p class="p1"><b>GEORGE ELIOT, "THREE MONTHS IN WEIMAR"</b></p>
<p class="p2">[The text below is based on a scan of the first published version of Eliot's essay, which appeared in <span class="s1"><i>Frasers Magazine for Town and Country</i> 51: 306 (June 1855): 699-706.]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">IT was between three and four o'clock on a fine morning in August that, after a ten hours' journey from Frankfort, I awoke at the Weimar station. No tipsiness can be more dead to all appeals than that, which comes from fitful draughts of sleep on a railway journey by night. To the disgust of your wakeful companions, you are totally insensible to the existence of your umbrella, and to the fact that your carpet bag is stowed under your seat, or that you have borrowed books and tucked them behind the cushion. 'What's the odds, so long as one can sleep?' is your formule de la vie, and it is not until you have begun to shiver on the platform, in the early morning air that you become alive to property and its duties, i.e., to the necessity of keeping a fast grip upon it. Such was my condition when I reached the station at Weimar. The ride to the town thoroughly roused me, all the more because the glimpses I caught from the carriage window were in startling contrast with my preconceptions. The lines of houses looked rough and straggling, and were often interrupted by trees peeping out from the gardens behind. At last we stopped before the, Erbprinz, an inn of long standing in the heart of the town, and were ushered along heavy-looking in-and-out corridors, such as are found only in German inns, into rooms which overlooked a garden just like one you may see at the back of a farm-house in many an English village.</p>
<p class="p4">A walk in the morning in search of lodgings confirmed the impression that Weimar was more like a market town than the precinct of a court. 'And this is the Athens of the North!' we said. Materially speaking, it is more like Sparta. The blending of rustic and civic life, the indications of a central government in the midst of very primitive-looking objects, has some distant analogy with the condition of old Lacedaemon to shops are most of them, such as you would, see in: the back street-s of an English provincial town, and the commodities on sale are often chalked op the doorposts A loud rumbling of vehicles may indeed be heard now and then; but the rumbling is loud not because the vehicles are many,</p>
<p class="p4">700</p>
<p class="p4">but because the springs are few. The inhabitants seemed to us to have more than the usual heaviness of Germanity; even their stare was slow, like that of herbivorous quadrupeds We set out with the intention of exploring the town, and at every other turn we came into a street which took us out of the town, or else into one that led us back to the market from which we set out. One's first feeling was--how could Goethe live here in this dull, lifeless village? The reproaches cast on him for his worldliness and attachment to court splendour seemed ludicrous enough, and it was inconceivable that the stately Jupiter en redingote, so familiar to us all through Rauch's statuette, could have habitually walked along these rude streets and among these slouching mortals. Not a picturesque bit of building was to be seen; there was no quaintness, nothing to remind one of historical associations, nothing but the most arid prosaism.</p>
<p class="p4">This was the impression produced by a first morning's walk in Weimar, an impression which very imperfectly represents what Weimar is; but which is worth recording, because it is true as a sort of back view. Our ideas were considerably modified when, in the evening, we found our way to the Belvedere chaussee, a splendid avenue of chesnut trees, two miles in length, reaching from the town to the summer residence of Belvedere; when we saw the Schloss, and discovered the labyrinthine beauties of the park; indeed, every day opened to us fresh charms in this quiet little valley and its environs. To any one who loves Nature in her gentle aspects, who delights in the chequered shade on a summer morning, and in a walk on the corn-clad upland at sunset, within sight of a little town nestled among the trees below, I say--come to Weimar. And If you are weary of English unrest, of that society of 'eels in a jar,' where each is trying to get his head above the other, the somewhat stupid bienetre of the Weimarians will not be an unwelcome contrast, for a short time at least. If you care nothing about-Goethe and Schiller and Herder and Wieland, why, so much the worse for you--you will miss many interesting thoughts and associations; still Weimar has a charm independent of these great names.</p>
<p class="p4">First among all its attractions is the Park, which would be remarkably beautiful even among English parks, and it has one advantage over all these, namely, that it is without a fence. It runs up to the houses, and far out into the corn fields and meadows, as if it had a 'sweet will' of its own, like a river or a lake, and had not been planned and planted by human will. Through it flows the Ilm--not a clear stream, it must be confessed, but like all water, as Novalis says, 'an eye to the landscape.' Before we came to Weimar we had had dreams of boating on the Ilm, and we were not a little amused at the difference between this vision of our own and the reality. A few water-fowl are the only navigators of the river, and even they seem to confine themselves to one spot, as if they were there purely in the interest of the picturesque. The real extent of to park is small, but the walks are so ingeniously arranged, and the trees are so luxuriant and various, that it takes weeks to learn the turnings and windings by heart, so as no longer to have the sense of, novelty. In the warm weather our great delight was the walk which follows the course of to Ilm, and is overarched by tall trees with patches of dark moss on their trunks, in rich contrast with the transparent green of the delicate leaves, through which the golden sunlight played, and chequered the walk before us. On one side of this walk the rocky ground rises to the height of twenty feet or more, and is clothed with mosses and rock plants; on the other side there are, every now and then, openings--breaks in the continuity of shade, which show you a piece of, meadow land, with fine groups of trees; and at every such opening a seat is placed under the rock, where you may sit and chat away the sunny hours, or listen to those delicate sounds which one might fancy came from tiny bells worn on the garment of Silence to make us aware of her invisible presence. It is along this walk that you come upon a truncated column with a serpent twined round it, devouring cakes, placed on the column</p>
<p class="p4">701</p>
<p class="p4">as offerings--a bit of rude sculpture in stone. The inscription--Genio loci--enlightens the learned as to the significance of this symbol, but the people of Weimar, unedified by classical allusions, have explained the sculpture by a story which is an excellent example of a modern myth. Once upon a time, say they, a huge serpent infested the-park, and evaded all attempts to exterminate him; until at last a cunning baker made some appetizing cakes which contained an effectual poison, and placed them in the serpents reach, thus meriting a place with Hercules, Theseus, and other monster-slayers. Weimar, in gratitude, erected this column as a memorial of the bakers feat, and its own deliverance. A little farther on is the Borkenhaus, where Carl August used to play the hermit for days together, and from which he used to telegraph to Goethe in his Gartenhaus. Sometimes we took our shady walk in the Stern, the oldest part of the park plantations, on the opposite side of the river, lingering on our way to watch the crystal brook which hurries on, like a foolish young maiden, to wed itself with the muddy Ilm. The Stern (Star), a large circular opening amongst the trees, with walks radiating from it, has been thought of as the place for the projected statues of Goethe and Schiller. In Rauch's model for these statues the poets are draped in togas, Goethe, who was considerably the shorter of the two, resting his hand on Schiller's shoulder; but it has been wisely determined to represent them in their 'habit as they lived,' so Rauch's design is rejected. Of classical idealising in portrait sculpture, Weimar has already a sufficient exemplar ad evitandum in the colossal statue of Goethe executed after Bettina's design, which the readers of the 'Correspondence with a Child' may see engraved as a frontispiece to the second volume. This statue is locked up in an odd structure, standing in the park. and looking like a compromise between a church and a summer-house (Weimar does not shine in its buildings!). How little real knowledge of Goethe must the mind have that could wish to see him represented as a naked Appollo with a Psyche at his knee! The execution is as feeble as the sentiment is false; the Apollo-Goethe is a caricature, and the Psyche is simply vulgar. The statue was executed under Bettina's encouragement, in the hope that it would be bought by the King of Prussia; but a breach having taken place between her and her royal friend, a purchaser was sought in the Grand Duke of Weimar, who, after transporting it at enormous expense from Italy, wisely shut it up where it is seen only by the curious.</p>
<p class="p4">As autumn advanced and the sunshine became precious, we preferred the broad walk on the higher grounds of the park, where the masses of trees are finely disposed, leaving wide spaces of meadow which extend on one side to the Belvedere allee with its avenue of chesnut trees, and on the other to the little cliffs which I have already described as forming a wall by the walk along the Thri. Exquisitely beautiful were the graceful forms of the plane: trees, thrown in golden relief on a back-ground of: dark pines Here we used to turn and turn again in the autumn afternoons, at first bright and wann, then sombre with low-lying, purple clouds; and chill with winds that sent the leaves raining from the branches. The eye here welcomes, as a contrast, the white facade of a building looking like a small Greek temple, placed on the edge of the cliff, and you at once conclude it to be a bit of pure ornament--a device to set off the landscape; but you presently see a porter seated near the door of the basement story, beguiling the ennui of his sinecure by a book and a pipe, and you learn with surprise that this is another retreat for ducal dignity to unbend and philosophize in. Singularly ill-adapted to such a purpose it seems to beings not ducal. On the other side of the Ilm the park is bordered by the road leading to the little village of Ober Weimar, another sunny walk which has the special attraction of taking one by Goethe's Gartenhaus, his first residence at Weimar. Inside, this Gartenhaus is a homely sort of cottage, such as many an English nobleman's gardener lives in; no furniture is left in it, and the family wish to sell it. Outside, its</p>
<p class="p4">702</p>
<p class="p4">aspect became to us like that of a dear friend whose irregular features and rusty clothes have a peculiar charm, It stands with its bit of garden and orchard, on a pleasant slope, fronting the west; before it the park stretches one of its meadowy openings to the trees which fringe the Ilm, and between this meadow and the garden hedge lies the said road to Ober Weimar. A grove of weeping birches sometimes tempted us to turn out of this road up to the fields at the top of the slope, on which not only the Gartenhaus, but several other modest villas are placed. From this little height, one sees to advantage the plantations of the park in their autumnal colouring; the town, with its steep-roofed church, and castle clock-tower, painted a gay green; the bushy line of the Belvedere chaussee, and Belvedere itself peeping on an eminence from its nest of trees. Here, too, as the place for seeing a lovely sunset--such a sunset as September sometimes gives us when the western horizon is like a rippled seat of gold, sending over the whole hemisphere golden vapours, which, as they near the east, are subdued to a deep rose-colour.</p>
<p class="p4">The Schloss is rather a stately, ducal-looking building, forming three sides of a quadrangle. Strangers are admitted to see a suite of rooms called the Dichter-Zimmer (Poets' Rooms), dedicated to Goethe, Schiller, and Wieland. The idea of these rooms is really a pretty one: in each of them there is a bust of the poet who is its presiding genius, and the walls of the Schiller and Goethe rooms are covered with frescoes representing scenes from their works. The Wieland room is much smaller than the other two, and serves as an antechamber to them; it is also decorated more sparingly, but the arabesques on the walls are very tastefully designed, and satisfy one better than the ambitious compositions from Goethe and Schiller. A more interesting place to visitors is the library, which occupies a large building not far from the Schloss. The principal Saal, surrounded by a broad gallery, is ornamented with some very excellent busts and some very bad portraits. Of the busts, the most remarkable is that of Gluck, by Houdon--a striking specimen of the real in art. The sculptor has given every scar made by the small-pox; he has 1eft the nose as pug and insignificant, and the mouth as common, as Nature made them; but then he has done what, doubtless, Nature also did--he has made one feel in those coarsely-cut features the presence of the genius qui divinise la laideur. A specimen of the opposite style in art is Trippel's bust of Goethe as the young Apollo, also fine in its way. It was taken when Goethe was in Italy; and in the Italianische Reise, mentioning the progress of the bust, he says that he sees little likeness to himself but is not discontented that he should go forth to the world as such a hubscher Bursch--a good-looking fellow. This bust, however, is a frank idealization; when an artist tells us that the ideal of a Greek god divides his attention with his immediate subject, we are warned to take his representation cum grano. But one gets rather irritated with idealization in portrait when, as in Dannecker's bust of Schiller, one has been misled into supposing that Schiller's brow was square and massive, while, in fact, it was receding. We say this partly on the evidence of his skull, a cast of which is kept in the library, so that we could place it in juxtaposition with the bust. The story of this skull is curious. When it was determined to disinter Schiller's remains, that they might repose in company with those of Carl August and Goethe, the question of identification was found to be a difficult one, for his bones were mingled with those of ten insignificant fellow mortals. When, however, the eleven skulls were placed in juxtaposition, a large number of persons who had known Schiller, separately and successively fixed upon the same skull as his, and their evidence was clenched by the discovery that the teeth of this skull corresponded to the statement of Schiller's servant, that his master had lost no teeth, except one, which he specified. Accordingly it was decided that this was Schiller's skull, and the comparative anatomist, Loder, was sent for from Jena,</p>
<p class="p4">703</p>
<p class="p4">to select the bones which completed the skeleton.* The evidence certainly leaves room for a doubt; but the front fuyant of the skull agrees with the testimony of persons who knew Schiller, that he had, as Rauch said to us, a 'miserable forehead;' it agrees, a1so, with a beautiful miniature of Schiller, taken when he was about twenty. This miniature is deeply interesting; it shows us a youth whose clearly cut features, with the mingled fire and melancholy of their expression, could hardly have been passed with indifference; it has the langer gansehals (long goose-neck), which he gives to his Karl Moor; but instead of the black, sparkling eyes, and the gloomy, overhanging, bushy eye-brows he chose for his robber hero, it has the fine wavy, auburn locks and the light-blue eyes, which belong to our idea of pure German race. We may be satisfied that we know at least the form of Schiller's features, for in this particular his busts and portraits are in striking accordance; unlike the busts and portraits of Goethe, which are a proof, if any were wanted, how inevitably subjective art is, even when it professes to be purely imitative--how the most active perception gives us rather a reflex of what we think and feel, than the real sum of objects before us. The Goethe of Rauch or of Schwanthaler is widely different in form, as well as expression, from the Goethe of Stieler; and Winterberger, the actor, who knew Goethe intimately, told us that to him not one of all the likenesses, sculptured or painted, seemed to have more than a faint resemblance to their original. There is, indeed, one likeness, taken in his old age, and preserved in the library, which is startling from the conviction it produces of close resemblance, and Winterberger admitted it to be the best he had seen. It is a tiny miniature painted on a small cup, of Dresden china, and is so wonderfully executed, that a magnifying-glass exhibits the perfection of its texture as if it were a flower or a butterfly's wing. It is more like Stieler's portrait than any other; the massive neck, unbent though withered, rises out of his dressing gown, and supports majestically a head, from which one might imagine (though, alas! it never is so in reality) that the discipline of seventy years had purged away all meaner elements than those of the sage and the poet--a head which might serve as a type of sublime old age. Amongst the collection of toys and trash, melancholy records of the late Grand Duke's eccentricity, which occupy the upper rooms of the library, there are some precious relics hanging together in a glass case, which almost betray one into sympathy with 'holy coat' worship. They are--Luther's gown, the coat in which Gustavus Adolphus was shot, and Goethe's court coat and schlafrock. What a rush of thoughts from the mingled memories of the passionate reformer, the heroic warrior, and the wise singer!</p>
<p class="p4">The only one of its great men to whom Weimar has at present erected a statue in the open air is Herder. His statue, inaugurated in 1850, stands in what is called the Herder Platz, with its back to: the church in which he preached; in the right hand is a roll bearing his favourite motto--Licht, Liebe, Leben (Light, Love, Life), and on the pedestal is the inscription--von Deutscher aller lande (from Germans of all lands). This statue, which is by Schaller of Munich, is very much admired; but, remembering the immortal description in the Dichtung und Wahrheit, of Herder's appearance when Goethe saw him for the first time at Strasburg, I was disappointed with the parsonic appearance of the statue, as well as of the bust in the library. The part of the town which imprints itself on the memory, next to the Herder Platz, is the Markt, a cheerful square, made smart by a new Rath-haus. Twice a week it is crowded with stalls and country people, and it is the very pretty custom for the band to play in balcony of the Rath-haus</p>
<p class="p5">Footnote: I tell this story from my recollection of Stahr's account in his Weimar und Jena, an account which was confirmed to me by residents in Weimar; but as I have not the book by me, I cannot test the accuracy of my memory.</p>
<p class="p4">704</p>
<p class="p4">about twenty minutes every market-day to delight the ears of the peasantry. A head-dress worn by many of the old women, and here and there by a young one, is, I think, peculiar to Thuringia. Let the fair reader imagine half-a-dozen of her broadest French sashes dyed black, and attached as streamers to the back of a stiff black skullcap, ornamented in front with a large bow, which stands out like a pair of donkey's ears; let her further imagine, mingled with: the streamers of ribbon, equally broad pendents of a thick woollen texture, something like the fringe of an urn-rug, and she will have an idea of the head-dress in which I have seen a Thuringian damsel figure on a hot summer's day. Two houses in the Markt are pointed out as those from which Tetzel published his indulgences and Luther thundered against them; but it is difficu1t to one's imagination to conjure up scenes of theological controversy in Weimar, where, from princes down to pastry-cooks, rationalism is taken as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="p4">Passing along the Schiller-strasse, a broad, pleasant street, one is thrilled by the inscription, Hier wohnte Schiller, over the door of it small house with casts in its bow window. Mount up to the second story and you will see Schiller's study very nearly as it was when he worked in it. It is a cheerful room with three windows, two towards the street and one looking on a little garden which divides his house from the neighbouring one. The writing-table, which he notes as an important purchase in one of his letters to Korner, and in one of the drawers of which he used to keep rotten apples for the sake of their scent, stands near the last-named window, so that its light would fall on his left hand. On another side of the room is his piano, with his guitar lying upon it, and above these hangs an ugly print of an Italian scene, which has a pendant equally ugly on another wall. Strange feelings it awakened in me to run my fingers over the keys of the little piano and call forth its tones, now so queer and feeble, like those of an invalided old woman whose voice could once make a heart beat with fond passion, or soothe its angry pulses into calm. The bedstead on which Schiller died has been removed into the study, from the small bedroom behind, which is now empty. A little table is placed close to the head of the bed with his drinking glass upon it, and on the wall above the bedstead there is a beautifu1 sketch of him lying dead. He used to occupy the whole of the second floor. It contains, besides the study and bedroom, an ante-chamber, now furnished with casts and prints on sale, in order to remunerate the custodiers of the house, and a salon tricked out, since his death, with a symbolical cornice, statues, and a carpet worked by the ladies of Weimar.</p>
<p class="p4">Goethe's house is much more important looking, but, to English eyes, far from being the palatial residence which might be expected, from the descriptions of German writers. The entrance hall is indeed rather imposing, with its statues in niches, and its broad staircase, but the rest of the house is not proportionately spacious and elegant. The only part of the house open to the public--and this only on a Friday--is the principal suite of rooms which contain his collection of casts, pictures, cameos, &amp;c. This collection is utterly insignificant, except as having belonged to him, and one turns away from bad pictures and familiar casts, to linger over the manuscript of the wonderful Romische Elegien, written by himself in the Italian character. It is to be regretted that a large sum offered for this house by the German Diet, was refused by the Goethe family in the hope, it is said, of obtaining a still larger sum from that mythical English Croesus always ready to turn fabulous sums into dead capital, who haunts the imagination of continental people. One of the most fitting tributes a nation can pay to its great dead, is to make their habitation, like their works, a public possession, a shrine where affectionate reverence may be more vividly reminded that the being who has bequeathed to us immortal thoughts or immortal deeds, had to endure the daily struggle with the petty details, perhaps with the sordid</p>
<p class="p4">705</p>
<p class="p4">cares, of this working-day world; and it is a sad pity that Goethe's study, bedroom, and library, so fitted to call up that kind of sympathy, because they are preserved just as he left them, should be shut out from all but the specially privileged. We were happy enough to be amongst these--to look through the mist of rising tears at the dull study with its two small windows, and without a single object chosen for the sake of luxury or beauty; at the dark little bedroom with the bed on which he died, and the arm-chair where he took his morning coffee as he read; at the library with its common deal shelves, and books containing his own paper marks. In the presence of this hardy simplicity, the contrast suggests itself of the study at Abbotsford, with its elegant gothic fittings, its delicious easy chair, and its oratory of painted glass.</p>
<p class="p4">We were very much amused at the privacy with which people keep their shops at Weimar. Some of them have no kind of enseigne--not so much as their names written up; and there is so much nonchalance towards customers, that one might suppose every shopkeeper was a salaried functionary employed by government. The distribution of commodities, too, is carried on according to a peculiar Weimarian logic: we bought our lemons at a seiler's, or ropemaker's, and should not have felt ourselves very unreasonable if we had asked for shoes at a stationer's. As to competition, I should think a clever tradesman or artificer is almost as free from it at Weimar as Aesculapius or Vulcan in the days of old Olympus. Here is an illustration. Our landladv's husband was called the 'susser Rabenhorst,' by way of distinguishing him from a brother of his who was the reverse of sweet. This Rabenhorst, who was not sweet, but who nevertheless dealt in sweets, for he was a confectioner, was so utter a rogue that any transaction with him was avoided almost as much as if he had been the Evil One himself, yet so clever a rogue that he always managed to keep on the windy side of the law. Nevertheless, he had so many dainties in the confectionery line--so viel Sussigkeiten und Leckerbissen--that people bent on giving a fine entertainment were at last constrained to say, 'After all, I must go to Rabenhorst;' and so he got abundant custom, in spite of general detestation.</p>
<p class="p4">A very fair dinner is to be had at several tables d'hote in Weimar for ten or twelve groschen (a shilling or fifteenpence). The Germans certainly excel us in their mehlspeise, or farinaceous puddings, and in their mode of cooking vegetables; they are bolder and more imaginative in their combination of sauces, fruits and vegetables with animal food, and they are faithful to at least one principle of dietetics--variety. The only thing at table we have any pretext for being supercilious about is the quality and dressing of animal food. The meat at a table d'hote in Thuringia, and even at Berlin, except in the very first hotels, bears about the same relation to ours as cat or horse-flesh probably bears to German beef and mutton; and an Englishman with a bandage over his eyes would often be sorely puzzled to guess the kind of flesh he was eating. For example, the only flavour we could ever discern in hare, which is a very frequent dish, was that of the more or less disagreeable fat which predominated in the dressing; and roast meat seems to be considered an extravagance rarely admissible. A melancholy sight is a flock of Weimarian sheep, followed or led by their shepherd. They are as dingy as London sheep, and far more skinny; indeed, an Englishman who dined with us said the sight of the sheep had set him against mutton. Still, the variety of dishes you get for ten groschen is something marvellous to those who have been accustomed to English charges, and among the six: courses it is not a great evil to find a dish or two the reverse of appetizing. I suppose, however, that the living at tables d'hote gives one no correct idea of the mode in which the people live at home. The basis of the national food seems to be raw ham and sausage, with a copious superstratum of blaukraut, sauerkraut, and black bread. Sausage (wurst) seems to be to the German what potatoes were to the Irish--the sine qua non of bodily</p>
<p class="p4">706</p>
<p class="p4">sustenance. Goethe asks the Frau von Stein to end him so eine wurst when he wants to have a make-shift dinner away from home; and in his letters to Kestner he is enthusiastic about the delights of dining on blaukraut and leberwurst (blue cabbage and liver sausage). If kraut and wurst may be called the solid prose of Thuringian diet, fish and kuchen: (generally a heavy kind of fruit tart) are the poetry: the German appetite disports itself with these as the English appetite does with ices and whipped creams.</p>
<p class="p4">At the beginning of August, when we arrived in Weimar, almost everyone was away--'at the Baths,' of course--except the tradespeople. As birds nidify in the spring, so Germans wash themselves in the summer; their waschungstrieb acts strongly only at a particular time of the year; during all the rest, apparently, a decanter and a sugar-basin or pie-dish, are an ample toilette service for them: We were quite contented, however, that it was not yet the Weimar season, fashionably speaking, since it was the very best time for enjoying something far better than Weimar gaieties--the lovely park and environs. It was pleasant, too, to see the good bovine bourgeoisie enjoying life in their quiet fashion. Unlike our English people, they take pleasure into their calculations, and seem regularly to set aside part of their time for recreation. It is understood that something is to be done in life besides business and housewifery: the women take their children and their knitting to the Erholung, or walk with their husbands to Belvedere, or in some other direction, where a cup of coffee is to be had. The Erholung, by the way, is a pretty garden, with shady walks, abundant seats, an orchestra, a ball-room, and a place for refreshments. The higher classes are subscribers and visitors here as well as the bourgeoisie; but there are several resorts of a similar kind frequented by the latter exclusively. The reader of Goethe will remember his little poem, Die Lustigen von Weimar, which still indicates the round of amusements in this simple capital: the walk to Belvedere or Tiefurt, the excursion to Jena, or some other trip, not made expensive by distance; the round game at cards; the dance; the theatre; and so many other enjoyments to be had by a people not bound to give dinner parties and 'keep up a position.' Another time I will tell what we saw of these recreations, rural and theatrical; of lovely walks along chaussees bordered by plum-trees laden with purple fruit, or by the mountain ash, lifting its bunches of coral against the sky, to country seats where no gate or padlock obstructs your entrance, and no gardener haunts you, expectant of a fee, and to happy-looking villages--each with its little patch of fields and little lot of hills; of excursions to the classic Jena and the romantic Ilmenau; and, for a variety, of Weimar fairs and target-shooting, and Wagner operas presided over by Liszt.</p>
